# Embedded Gateway Simulator using gRPC & Protobuf

This project simulates a realistic embedded system gateway using Python, gRPC, and Protocol Buffers. It models how a mobile/cloud application communicates with a connected embedded product through a gateway — a pattern commonly used in IoT systems (e.g., smart homes, industrial sensors).

---

## 🔧 Features

- **gRPC Server** simulating an embedded gateway
- **gRPC Client** simulating a cloud or mobile app
- **Protobuf messages** for structured, binary-compatible communication
- Supports RPCs for:
  - Setting configuration (e.g., sample rate, WiFi)
  - Controlling hardware (e.g., light on/off)
  - Getting status
  - Streaming telemetry (temperature, humidity)
- Optional conversion to serialized binary data (e.g., for UART transmission)
- Logging to file for debugging and replay

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Install Dependencies
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install grpcio grpcio-tools
```

### 🛠 Compile Protobuf
```bash
python -m grpc_tools.protoc \
  -I protos \
  --python_out=. \
  --grpc_python_out=. \
  protos/gateway.proto
```

### ▶ Run the Server
```bash
python server.py
```

### ▶ Run the Client
In a new terminal (while server is running):
```bash
python client.py
```

## 🧠 Real-World Relevance
This project mimics the architecture used in embedded companies like Google Nest, Tesla, and others:
- Binary-encoded telemetry via Protobuf
- Edge-device to cloud communication via gRPC
- Test harnesses using simulated gateways

Even if the physical product uses UART and REST, this simulation provides:
- Automation
- Testable behavior
- Reusable tooling
